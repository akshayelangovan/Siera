Well, I tuned in same as everyone to watch the [keynote presentation of September 2017](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/) live streaming from the Steve Jobs Theatre. (Yes, the theatre is named after Steve Jobs).

Starting off with "Today at Apple",(that's when I started to watch, sorry if I missed something) it's a cool idea. It brings and connects people together. I love things which embraces humanity and the feeling that we give and take and find happiness in sharing. Even brilliant when technology does that. Asimov would have raised an eyebrow.

Next off, Tim introduces the [Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/). Watches are lovely, brilliant things. My father used to design watches. But a new generation of watches that no longer required mechanical moving components were made and it appealed to electronic hobbyists. In this decade, we witnessed wathces becoming smarter, acting as one being with our smartphones, and being more than a digital timepiece on our wrists. Apple took it to a whole new level with the Watch series 3. God, the beautiful design that caught everyone's eyes that were even glancing at it even in the corner. This is why Apple's products are loved by industrial designers. It is minimilastic. I haven't used a smartwatch before so I'm gonna pass some things that it could do like wake you up, monitor your heart rate, check your activity levels, show messages and update you of your schedule, and many more. It could do a lot of things. Here's what I found interesting. "40 million songs on your wrist". Yeah, no kidding. Imagine taking your daily run. Wear your Watch, plug in your Airpods, you'll probably carry your phone with you anyway. No sweat. Personally, I think the Airpods are sweet. No longer do you have to worry about the dangling wires. They fit right in your ears like, umm... well, easier than sticking a USB in it's port. In short, minimalistic and mind-blowing.

[Apple tv](https://www.apple.com/tv/)! 4K wasn't enough, you guys went ahead and gave other companies something to chase after. 4K HDR. Crisp and vibrant details. I'm leaving links to Apple's website all over. Feel free to head over.
The [iPhone 8 and 8 plus](https://www.apple.com/iphone-8/), alright, now we're in business. Glass finish, okay, Disney-ish but i dig it. One highlight that was brought up was "most durable glass". Like GLASS... DURABLE... Read that twice in your mind dramatically. Then an aerospace grade aluminium band. Hmm, why not! It's not a phone that just looks and feels premium. It is premium. Wireless charging, portrait mode and a camera that uses machine learning, we need days to even imagine what a smartphone from a future could do to beat that. By this time, I ran down to my friend's room to ask him about the bezel-less phone that was teased. I mean, it hasn't been unveiled yet.

My mistake, should have stuck with the monitor and seen it for myself. The [iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/)! It is pronounced iPhone Ten and not iPhone Ex. I'm not gonna write about the specs and the build. What I'm going to write about is why it is special. The front looks absolutely beautiful. Its something straight out of movie teasing futuristic mobile devices. No home button. This is actually bold. I see this as Apple's fearless move in bringing a revolution. This is what Apple used to be. When they brought icons, colourful computers, made a computer speak at a product launch, introduced the world to the iPod, to the iPhone, the Airpods. It breaks down conventional and shows us something new and exciting.

<h1>Quoting Sol LeWitt, "Don't worry about cool. Make your own uncool"</h1>

Just brilliant. If I may, <b>insanely great</b>. "I think Steve would've been proud of them", Tim said. I love this looking back and reflecting, what would've Steve did if he hadn't left us. That's what makes it special. It has Steve's touch in it. His drive to remove those ugly buttons, increase human interaction with his devices instead of a stylus and actual love for a product even before they have touched it. How would people know what they want if they haven't seen it yet? And guess what we want after we see. His vision is still a part of Apple's and he is still with us. I love it. <b>It's brilliant.</b>

The Steve Jobs theatre offers an arena for hands on experience, delivering technology to the hands of people so that they can see how much detail has gone into the making of an Apple product. There's just so much love.

PS: I almost forgot about [Jonathan Ive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4wEI5zhHB0). I just started smiling when I saw him in the ad. Oh and the videos that were shown were absolutely stunning. Make sure you check them out.
