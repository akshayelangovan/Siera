It's the end of the year and we've all come this far.

It must've been a rough ride for some, relishable sweet memories for others, a year of growth or a time of realization, an idea sparked, a rising wildfire in your heart. Whatever this year has given you, I hope you are well.

The year must've started with great aspirations after we waved goodbye to 2016. Some might've been corageous to commit themselves with a resolution. A new year suddenly feels like we've been gifted another opportunity to write another chapter of our own. But let's look back and see what we've done with the last chapter. Were there any goals you set for the year? Did you become a better person or pick up any new skill? Have you made any friends among strangers and touched each others lives? Did you let the others touch your life? Have you given yourself enough time to think and reflect if you are doing what you want to do? Did you make someone's life better? Did you become tolerant? Do you sense your belonging to this planet?

Once you've reflected and find atleast one 'No' to the above thoughts, I have an idea that I want to install in you. Whatever be the quest you set out on this year, if you haven't completed it, now's the time. December isn't the month of brooding and worrying about how the year was futile, hard and mean. Or maybe you are thinking, that you've shortened your lifespan. I don't know if people do that, but now's the time to be most optimistic. It can be done. This month is when you have to find the strength to make things right, do everything that you wanted to do this year and find the satisfaction at the end of the road that can make you feel home by saying "You gave your best shot". Give it your all. Don't look forward to the next year till New Year's Eve. 
<h2>'Executing instead of wishing' should be your motto</h2>
Here's the idea. Find the strength and optimism to achieve the goals you set for the year. Start now! Do everything in your capability to make you feel that ths year was well and helped you grow. <b>When you've done that, I am sure the next year would do you one better.</b>

<h1>You've got just this month to do justice to this year! Start now!</h1>
