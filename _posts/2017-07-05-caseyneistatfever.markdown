I stopped watching television after I moved to college. I kept watching Hollywood movies and then started them series. But when I had just a few minutes to waste and my WiFi hasn't expired, I'll lay back and watch YouTube videos on my phone. This stuck on as a habit and now I usually find myself watching YouTube on a daily basis spending way more than a few minutes. Awesome Content.

Two weeks ago Casey Neistat's [Do What You Can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7dSXcfVqE&t=2s) video landed on my recommendations. It blew me away. The movie was well naratted, the visual was equally treating and inspirational. This is how I got introducted to Casey. Thank you, YouTube.

After that I was more than willing to check out his channel, but when I saw vlogs, let's say I wasn't appealed. During my early days of being a YouTube fan, I followed Marcus Butler like crazy. But I wasn't really interested in his vlog content, it was the rants that kept me tuned. Being someone who does not prefer vlogs, I tried his [channel anyway](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat) anyway because the content seemed good. Actually more than good, they are great, I've been binge watching them recently (not chronologically).

I liked Casey's channel, the videos weren't boring, positive vibes passed whilst watching them, him being the guy who's been there and done that. Following through his camera, his daily life, all the little parts, the cinematography, the labour he takes for editing and presenting, his idea of story-telling that always pulls my head to listen to. Casey Neistat is an amazing film-maker.

Seeing him be him, makes me want to be me. The way he shows life beautifully instead of looking at it as routine urges me to change to a positive perspective. And if you watch his videos, sooner or later you're gonna fall in love with either the boosted board or the glasses. This man is an amazing person, he has an inspiring history and a story to be told everyday.

I like him, he's cool! One more amazing person added to my "People who i think are awesome" list.
