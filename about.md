Hi, this is Gibberich, my blog. My name is Akshay Elangovan and I'm presently an engineering student at VIT University.

I initially wanted to do this to commit my spare time and use this as my escape into the splendid world of internet.

I like to talk about a lot of things starting from where we came from to where we are about to go.

I consider myself to be a lot of things: Stevian, ambitious , hungry and foolish, aspiring inventor, amateur astronomer, physics lover, visionary, more of a dreamer, engineer

If you wish to contact me, you can mail me at <b>akshayelangovan@gmail.com</b>
